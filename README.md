## II - Context : 4th Project realized during my training in Web Development with OpenClassrooms

---

From a given backend I had to implement the Frontend of the a website of E-commerce only using JAVASCRIPT Vanilla.

With this app you will be able to create your own cart of products and manage it by the user interface.

The cart will be saved locally to be able to finalize your order later.

Once you are ready to order, you can fill the form with all information asked. In case of bad information you will have a popup to help you to fill the form with correct information.

Then once it is validated, you will have your order number which will be displayed (coming from the backend).

## III - Installation :

---

### 1. Backend Prerequisites

You need Node and `npm` and `node` installed locally on your machine.

Clone this repo.

### 2. Installation

You have to install the backend of the project.
From the "back" folder of the project, run `npm install`. You
can then run the server with `node server`.
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
